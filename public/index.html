    <h1>Sudoku Solver</h1>
    <h3>Kevin Hooke, March 2019</h3>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>This is a Sudoku puzzle solver. Populate the puzzle grid below with a
    Sudoku puzzle and press the 'Solve' button.</p>
    <p>Note: this solver only currently works with 'proper' Sudoku puzzles (see
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_Sudoku#Minimum_number_of_givens">
        here</a>), which are puzzles with only a single, unique solution.</p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>This is a React web client to a Java based AWS Lambda that solves Sudoku puzzles.
    The content of the grid is sent to the Lambda, and if there is a single, unique solution,
    it is returned and displayed in the grid.</p>
    <p>The Solver uses my implementation of Donald Knuth's
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X">
        Algorithm X</a> and Dancing Links implemented in Java, which you can find
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kevinhooke/sudoku-solver-with-dlx">here</a>.</p>
